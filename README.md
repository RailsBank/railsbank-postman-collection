# Postman Collection

To help people get started with the Railsbank API, we've crafted this collection for Postman.

It may well fall out of date, as we primarily update the documentation, but if it is, please do raise a ticket and we'll see what we can do. PRs will be welcomed, too.

To use this:
 - install Postman
 - add in the collection (`Complete Railsbank API.postman_collection.json`)
 - add in the environment (`play.railsbank.com copy.postman_environment.json`)
 - dupicate the `play.railsbank.com copy` config to maybe `play.railsbank.com`
 - add in your API keys
